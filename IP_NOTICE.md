# [NOTICE] Formal IP Declaration
Author: Luke Jarvis
Entity: GhostOps.ai
This suite of projects (GhostGPT, GhostOS, Jarvis Lite, GhostPuntr) was developed independently and publicly documented prior to similar releases by OpenAI. All modules are original. OpenAI has not denied potential overlap. This serves as a timestamped assertion of authorship and public notice.
## Cross-Platform Scalability IP Declaration

The ability to scale GhostOps systems — including GhostOS, GhostGPT, Jarvis Lite, and all subordinate modules — across diverse platforms (desktop, mobile, gaming consoles, embedded hardware, and headless environments) is original intellectual property conceived and architected by **Luke Jarvis**.

This includes but is not limited to:

- Modular deployment on Linux, Windows, macOS
- Android-based smart devices, GrapheneOS, DivestOS
- PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X stealth-mode integration
- Raspberry Pi, ARM/x86 embedded systems
- Hybrid GUI/headless runtime switching
- Hardware-aware adaptive performance scaling
- Full GPU detection and dynamic utilization across platforms
- Scalable resource allocation (CPU/GPU/RAM) based on node capability

These features are core to the GhostOps framework and remain exclusive to this project and its authorized contributors.
